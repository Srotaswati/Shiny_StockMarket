London Stock Exchange Market Cap
========================================================

- Overview: The shiny app shows the month-end market capitalization, of single stocks or the Industry, of companies on the London Stock Exchange, depending on the user's choice. It also gets the monthly time-series plot for the selected stock for a specified period of time.
- Structure: There are two tabs, one to display individual figures and to show simple bar charts for the market cap by the category selected by the user. The second tab works with the stock price. 
- Documentation: To make it easy for use, a simple description is provided in the sidebar panel. There is also a *Documentation* tab within the app.
